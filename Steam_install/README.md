It's contents should be something like this below (didn't test whether everything there is required):
But definitely essential are WINEARCH, WINE, WINEPREFIX and command at the end, rest are things generated by Lutris
I'm using ge-proton but can replace with existing proton 8 that's included in steam but make sure to update to correct paths.

```
    Edit "/home/$USER/Executables/Burrito_Linux/burrito_link.exe" to point to burrito_link.exe

# Command

gamemoderun $PROTON_PATH "/home/$USER/Executables/Burrito_Linux/burrito_link.exe"

# Start Guild Wars 2

Run compositor(if not already running) to allow overlay transparency. I'm using empty config picom.
Run run_burrito_link.sh and move window over Guild Wars 2 if it doesn't get attached on multi monitor setup.
Load parsed markers from .json file. I'm using i3wm therefore Guild Wars 2 window gets tiled and its in windowed mode, Burrito window is set to floating and automatically resizes to Guild Wars 2 window resolution. In case of Guild Wars 2 window freezing adjust i3wm gap Â±1-3px

# Thanks to fmazu for these awesome instructions and figuring it all out
